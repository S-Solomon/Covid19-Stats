## Tech Stack
* React Js
* ChartJs
* Typescript
* Api


## Approach
I used async await to retrive json data from the [covid-19 postman Api](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc) and display it in a list. chartjs helps to give a visual representation and comparison of the results.


## Improvements
Maybe adding a search functionality where users would be able to easily search for countries.
improve the UI.
